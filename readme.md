Hi all,

This hangman game is based on the original work by [Code With Random](https://www.codewithrandom.com/). Please visit their site for the original version.

# Modifications

Here is a list of changes I made to the original work:

- Re-positioned the elements
- Changed the colours
- Revealed the word when losing the game
- Disabled the audio files
- Changed the time limit to 60 secs
- Added icons using FontAwesome
- Drew my version of Hangman
- Modified the CSS for better responsive design

Feel free to share your thoughts!
